## Note

Please be aware that the lab programs for the first and second semesters are not included in this repository. This is because, unfortunately, I did not back up those programs from that period.

Furthermore, this repository is intended purely for personal archival purposes. It is not a curated portfolio meant to showcase my skills, nor is it a "work of art." As this is just an archive, some programs may be unfinished, or other exercises may be missing entirely. Therefore, the collection may appear incomplete.
